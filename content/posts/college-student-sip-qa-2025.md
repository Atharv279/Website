## Introduction

Many young Indians want to start investing early, but don't know where to begin. In this Q&A, we answer a real question from a 19-year-old student and provide a step-by-step guide, real examples, and tips for building wealth from campus.

## Q: "I'm 19 and want to start investing. What's the best way to begin with SIPs?"

**A:**

Starting early is the best decision you can make for your financial future. Here's how you can get started with Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) as a college student in India.

### Step 1: Open a Zero-Balance Savings Account
Most banks offer student accounts with no minimum balance. Use your student ID to open one and enable online banking.

### Step 2: Choose a Low-Cost Index Fund
Look for an index mutual fund with a strong track record and low expense ratio. Examples: HDFC Index Fund, UTI Nifty Index Fund.

### Step 3: Set Up Your First SIP
Start with as little as ₹500/month. Use your bank's auto-debit feature to ensure discipline.

### Step 4: Track and Learn
Use free apps or your fund's dashboard to monitor your investments. Read up on market basics and stay curious.

## Real-World Example: Priya's SIP Journey

Priya, a 20-year-old engineering student in Pune, started a ₹500/month SIP in 2022. By 2025, her portfolio had grown to ₹22,000, despite market ups and downs. She credits her success to consistency and learning from Finance Flash's student webinars.
