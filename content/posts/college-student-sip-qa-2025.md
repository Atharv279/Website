## Q&A: Common Questions from College Students

### Q1: How much should I invest monthly?

**A:** Start with ₹100-500 per month. Even small amounts add up over time. You can increase as you earn more from internships or part-time jobs.

### Q2: Which funds should I choose?

**A:** Start with index funds or large-cap funds. They're less volatile and perfect for beginners. Avoid small-cap funds initially.

### Q3: What if I can't invest every month?

**A:** Most SIPs allow you to pause and restart. Don't worry about missing a month—focus on consistency over time.

### Q4: How do I track my investments?

**A:** Use the fund house's app or websites like Moneycontrol, Value Research. Check monthly, not daily.

### Q5: What about taxes?

**A:** SIPs in equity funds are tax-free if held for more than 1 year. For shorter periods, you pay 10% tax on gains above ₹1 lakh.

## Expert Interview: Financial Advisor for Students

We spoke with Rajesh Kumar, who specializes in student financial planning.

**Q:** What's the biggest mistake college students make with SIPs?

- Read the fund's fact sheet

### Step 3: Start Small

Allocate a portion of your internship stipend to SIPs. This creates a habit of saving and investing.

### 3. Learn While Investing
Use this time to understand markets, different fund types, and investment strategies.

Don't stop SIPs during market downturns. Continue investing regularly.

### 5. Increase Gradually
As you earn more (internships, part-time jobs), increase your SIP amount.
