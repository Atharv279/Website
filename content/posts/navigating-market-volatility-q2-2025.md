## Strategies for Managing Volatility

### 1. Stay Invested
History shows that staying invested through volatility often leads to better long-term returns. Time in the market beats timing the market.

### 2. Diversify Your Portfolio
Spread your investments across different asset classes, sectors, and geographies to reduce risk.

### 3. Use SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans)
SIPs help you buy more when prices are low and less when prices are high, averaging out your costs.

### 4. Maintain an Emergency Fund
Having 6-12 months of expenses in liquid assets prevents you from selling investments during market downturns.

### 5. Focus on Quality
Invest in companies with strong fundamentals, good management, and sustainable business models.
