## Introduction

In March 2025, the Patel family's textile export business in Surat faced a sudden 8% drop in the rupee. Instead of panicking, they used a hedging strategy learned from a Finance Flash webinar. By April, not only had they recovered losses, but they also secured a new contract in Dubai. This is their story—and a blueprint for other Indian SMEs facing currency risk.

## The Challenge: Currency Volatility Hits Home

The Patels have run their textile business for three generations. In early 2025, global events triggered a sharp depreciation of the rupee. For exporters, this can be a double-edged sword: while foreign earnings are worth more, input costs and contract obligations can spiral out of control. The Patels saw their profit margins shrink overnight.

## The Turning Point: Learning to Hedge

Rakesh Patel, the current managing director, attended a Finance Flash online seminar on currency risk. "We never thought currency risk could be managed so simply. The Finance Flash team's advice was a game-changer," he recalls. The family decided to hedge 50% of their USD receivables using forward contracts, and to renegotiate payment terms with key suppliers.
